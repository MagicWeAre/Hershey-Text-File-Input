# Hershey-Text-File-Input
A small modification to the Hershey Text Inkscape Extension by Evil Mad Scientist to allow multiline text.  
To install, copy into the inkscape extensions folder ("/usr/share/inkscape/extensions" in our case) overwriting the previous files. You may need to use sudo to access the usr folder. Then open Inkscape as usual.  
To use, procede as normal. In the dialog choose the "Typeset a text file" option. In the Text box, input the file's route and filename (with extension), relative to the home folder or equivalent.
